✅ **Java Testing – Practice Exercises**

🧩 **About This Repository**

This repository contains hands-on exercises focused on developing and refining unit testing skills in Java. It explores how to write expressive, reliable, and maintainable tests using JUnit 5 and AssertJ, applying them to real-world code patterns and scenarios.

📋 **Topics Covered**

🧪 **JUnit Basics**
  - Setting up test classes and methods with @Test

  - Using @BeforeEach and @AfterEach for setup and cleanup

  - Naming conventions for clarity and structure

✅ **Assertions**
  - assertEquals / assertNotEquals for comparing values

  - assertTrue, assertFalse for boolean conditions

  - assertNull, assertNotNull for null checks

  - assertArrayEquals for array comparison

  - assertIterableEquals for lists and collections
  

🧪 **Parameterized Tests**
  - Writing parameterized tests with @ParameterizedTest

  - Supplying test data using @ValueSource, @CsvSource, and @MethodSource

  - Reusing logic across multiple input scenarios

🚨 **Exception Testing**
  - Verifying thrown exceptions with assertThrows

  - Triggering and capturing errors like IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException, or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

🔍 **Advanced Assertions with AssertJ**
  - Fluent assertions for readability and precision
  
  - Checking collection contents, order, and size

  - Comparing Optional values

  - Testing Map keys and entries

🧩 **Integration Testing Basics**
  - Simulating simple system workflows

  - Verifying input/output behavior across classes

---

🎯 **Learning Objectives**
  - Understand the structure and lifecycle of JUnit tests

  - Practice testing object behavior, collections, and exceptions

  - Gain fluency writing fluent assertions with AssertJ

  - Improve debugging skills through intentional test failures

  - Learn to think like a tester: break code to make it better
