# 🚀 Testing Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a map and verify that it contains one of the keys that was added to it.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Testing in Java.

✅ Key Existence Assertion in a Map

This project includes an example that demonstrates how to test whether a Map in Java contains a specific key:

assertThat(map.containsKey(key)) — checks that the map includes the expected key after insertion.

This is a useful assertion when validating logic that adds entries to maps such as HashMap, ensuring data is indexed correctly.
