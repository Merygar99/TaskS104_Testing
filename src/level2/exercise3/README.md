# 🚀 Testing Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Testing in Java.

This project includes an example of using JUnit assertions to verify that two int[] arrays are identical in content and order:

✅ assertThat(actualArray).isEqualTo(expectedArray) — checks whether two integer arrays contain the same elements in the same sequence.

This type of assertion is especially useful when testing sorting algorithms, matrix operations, or any functionality that returns arrays.
