# 🚀 Testing Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create an empty Optional object. Write the correct assertion to verify that it is indeed empty.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Testing in Java.

✅ Validating an Empty Optional
This project includes an example demonstrating how to create an empty Optional in Java and assert that it contains no value:

Optional.empty() — creates an empty Optional instance.

assertThat(optional.isEmpty()) — confirms that the Optional is empty.

Such assertions are useful for testing methods that may return absent values and ensuring they behave predictably when no result is present.
