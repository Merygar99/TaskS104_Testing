# 🚀 Testing Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create an ArrayList containing several types of objects (create them as well). Write an assertion to verify the order of the objects in the ArrayList as they were inserted.

Now verify that the list contains the objects regardless of order. Verify that one of the objects was added only once to the list. Leave one object out and verify that the list does not contain this last one.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

✅ Object List Assertions with AssertJ

This project demonstrates how to test object handling within an ArrayList using assertions in Java:

- **Preserves Order**: Asserts that the list maintains the insertion order of different object instances.

- **Unordered Containment**: Verifies the list contains certain objects regardless of order.

- **Singular Presence**: Confirms an object appears only once in the list.

- **Exclusion Check**: Validates that an unadded object is not present in the list.

This exercise involves creating various object types and strengthens understanding of list behavior, reference equality, and JUnit assertions.
