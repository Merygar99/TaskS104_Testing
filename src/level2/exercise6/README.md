# 🚀 Testing Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Trigger an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in any class. Create an assertion that validates the exception is thrown as expected.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

✅ Exception Handling Assertion
This project includes an example that deliberately triggers an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and uses AssertJ to validate that the exception is correctly thrown:

assertThatExceptionOfType(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class).isThrownBy() — verifies that accessing an invalid index causes the expected exception.

This technique is valuable when testing how code responds to erroneous or boundary-breaking input, ensuring robust exception handling.
