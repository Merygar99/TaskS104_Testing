# 🚀 Testing Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

Create a class named CalculateId that calculates the corresponding letter of a ID number given its numeric part as a parameter.

Additionally, implement a JUnit test class to verify the correct behavior of CalculateId. The test should be parameterized to cover a broad range of input values and validate the correctness of the calculation using 10 predefined ID numbers.
